# KDEF
KDEF is a dictionary Discord bot made for a constructed language called 'Kygish'. However, with a little editing of the code, it could be used for any language.

Originally, KDEF was created using Discord.py version 1.0, but the changes made to the project to introduce slash commands have forced KDEF to migrate to using Pycord, instead.

Special thanks to the creator of Pycord and of Discord.py for making this project possible in an easy way.
